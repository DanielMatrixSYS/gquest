## Quest Creation Guide

This section is particularly useful for those looking to create their own quests. Here's what you need to know:

Different quests require different levels of Lua expertise. While I've made the quest creation process quite easy, I see that people still struggle with it. That's why I've created tutorial videos on how to create quests, which you can find in the .ZIP file you download with the script.

If you want to create complex quests, you will obviously need some Lua knowledge. However, if you want to build upon the quests I've already made for you, or simply create similar quests, you can copy and paste the quest and just edit the variables that need editing, then you're done!

Making the whole process automatic is something I've wanted to do for a while now, however, I don't think it's possible.

Happy creating! ðŸ˜Š
