--- This README file is not an actual quest, if you copy this over for your custom quest then you're bound to get errors!
--- In this README file I will try to explain what each variable means.
---

local QUEST = {};

--- QUEST.ID
--- The ID of the quest, this can be any number but it NEEDS to be UNIQUE.
--- So I would advice using long numbers like: 5813, etc.
QUEST.ID = 1;

--- QUEST.NPC
--- This decides what NPC(s) should have this quest. If you don't know your quest npc id then you need to go in-game and type,
--- !gquest -> NPCS -> Edit Existing NPCS and look to the left of the field and you'll find the quest npc.
--- This can be a table too, to have it so multiple npcs can have the same quest.
--- Change QUEST.NPC = 1 to QUEST.NPC = {1, 2};
QUEST.NPC = 1;

--- QUEST.Name
--- This is the name of the quest.
QUEST.Name = "Virus Threat";

--- QUEST.PreQuestConversationEnabled
--- This take a boolean of either true or false.
--- This enables or disables pre quest converations.
QUEST.PreQuestConversationEnabled = true;

--- QUEST.PreQuestConversation
--- If the above boolean is set to true then you can configure the pre quest conversation here:
--- It might look complicated, but it's just a simple table.
--- Here's an example from the sv_default1.lua quest, aka, Virus Threat.

--- This is the quest description.

--- QUEST.Cooldown
--- If this isn't a one time quest then how many seconds should it stay on cooldown?
QUEST.Cooldown = 3600;

--- QUEST.DeliverUponCompletion
--- Should the quest be automatically delivered so the player gets his reward once the quest has been completed?
--- This means that the player does not need to return to the quest npc in order to get his rewards/deliver his quest, it is done automatically.
---
--- NOTE:
--- NOTE:
--- This will make the OnCompletion function and OnCompleteDescription variable in the quest file useless!
QUEST.DeliverUponCompletion = false;

--- QUEST.CompletionTime
---
--- PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE THING BEFORE YOU USE THIS VARIABLE.
--- PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE THING BEFORE YOU USE THIS VARIABLE.
---
--- How long does the user have to complete this quest, in seconds?
--- After x amount of seconds the quest will be automatically be removed the players quest log
--- and he will have to re-accept the quest again in order to do it.
--- all progress will be lost, too.
---
--- If the player leaves the server whilst being on a timer then the quest will also be automatically removed from his quest log
--- This is to prevent strange behaviors.
---
--- If the server crashes then some strange behavior can occur, such as,
--- the player being able to do the quest even though there is no timer.
---
--- I can't really build a safety net for when your server crashes so I would recommend not using this if your server,
--- crashes frequently.

--- QUEST.NeedsToHaveCompleted
--- What quest does the player need to complete in order for them to see and accept this quest.
--- This is only used for a couple default quests.
---
--- This variable was changed on the 28/01/19
--- This variable can now be turned into a table of quests the user needs to have completed in order to accept whatever quest.
--- This means that NeedsToHaveCompleted = 1 can be turned into NeedsToHaveCompleted = {1, 2};
--- So the player needs to complete both one and two in order to accept whatever else quest.

--- QUEST.JobWhitelist
--- This is for DarkRP and DarkRP derived gamemodes.
--- what jobs CAN accept this quest.
--- Only one whitelist can be used at a time.
